# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of Credit Risk Analysis: 

The overall objective was to apply our machine learning skills to o predict credit risk. Using the credit card dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, I had to oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, I used a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Lastly, I compared two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier to predict credit risk. 

## Results: 

### Naive Random Oversampling 



### SMOTE Oversampling


### Undersampling


### Combination (Over and Under) Sampling


## Ensemble Learners:


### Balanced Random Forest Classifier


### Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier
